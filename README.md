# Daily-Road-Accident-Survival-Prediction-Analysis-Project 🚗💥

Welcome to the **Daily-Road-Accident-Survival-Prediction-Analysis-Project**! 🚨  
This project is designed to predict the survival chances of individuals involved in daily road accidents based on various features. The analysis and model development are carried out using **Python** and its libraries. Let's walk through the main points of the project! 👇

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib** 📉
- **Seaborn** 🌈
- **Scikit-learn** 🧠
- **XGBoost** 🌱
- **Jupyter Notebook** 💻

## 📅 Project Overview

Today, I built a **Daily Road Accident Survival Prediction Model**. The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual survives a road accident or not, using data from various road accidents. 🚑

## 🔍 Data Exploration (EDA)
1. **Loading and Preprocessing the Data** 🧹
   - Data was loaded and cleaned using **Pandas**.
   - Missing values were handled appropriately.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔎
   - Visualized the distribution of features like **age**, **vehicle type**, **accident severity**, and **weather conditions** 🌦️.
   - Analyzed correlations between features using heatmaps 🔥.

3. **Feature Engineering** ⚙️
   - Created new features based on existing data like **age groups** and **vehicle types** 🚗.
   - Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding 🔠.

4. **Handling Imbalanced Data** ⚖️
   - Used **SMOTE** for oversampling minority classes to balance the dataset ⚖️.

## 🏗️ Model Building
1. **Model Selection** 🧩
   - Implemented different machine learning models for prediction:
     - **Logistic Regression** ⚖️
     - **Random Forest** 🌳
     - **XGBoost** 🧑‍💻
   
2. **Model Evaluation** 📈
   - Evaluated models using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** 📊.
   - Performed **cross-validation** to avoid overfitting 📅.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning** 🔧
   - Tuned models using **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters ⚙️.

## 🚀 Results and Conclusion
- After fine-tuning the models, **XGBoost** showed the best performance in predicting survival chances with an accuracy of **85%**! 🎯
- This model can help in **predicting the survival chances** of individuals involved in daily road accidents based on the given features. 🏥
